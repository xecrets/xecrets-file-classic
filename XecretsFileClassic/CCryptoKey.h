//

//
//	2001-10-07	Initial
//
//	This object is used to store, cache and generate 128-bit keys.
//
//	As we generate keys, we have a *big* problem generating entropy for this.
//	Whenever there is a chance, the rest of the code should call a global instance
//	of this class to add bits as they come available. The primary source is from
//	user supplied keys, which we use as key-encrypting keys. The basic theory here
//	is that the fundamental security lies in how many bits the user supplies. That
//	we use separate data encrypting keys is really just to foil some attacks based
//	on similar clear text or known clear text. The other reason is to have the
//	possibility to support multiple keys/file or split-master-key schemes etc.
//
//	All actual data of this class must be stored on the CryptoHeap in which we trust...
//
//
//	Helper mini-class, contains the cache of keys.
