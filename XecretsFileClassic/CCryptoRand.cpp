//
//	A 128-bit random number is calculated using SHA-1 according to FIPS 186-2.
//
//	We use the algorithm in FIPS 186-2 such that the seed-key, XKEY, is actually
//	a fixed public value. If nothing else is done - this algorithm thus 'degenerates'
//	into a nonce-generator, still useful for Initialization Vectors but not for
//	Data Encrypting Keys.
//
//	To generate a Data Encrypting Key, an additional secret value called 'User Input'
//	or XSEED is needed. This should be based on the user-specified Key Encrypting Key
//	as that is the only really secret value we have.
//
//	To generate 'secure' random numbers, and not just nonces, you MUST give a new SEED
//	before every such generation.
//
//	The code also adds in a time stamp to ensure that a re-run under similar situations
//	still will generate unique Data Encrypting Keys and nonces. The time stamp comes both
//	from the tick-counter and from Time of Day clock.
//
//	TODO:	Add some 'true' randomness into the 'entropy pool' m_putXSeed, probably by having
//			a timer pick something up, such as mouse pointer position change or whatever.

//	Generating random data is *hard*... We have an 'entropy pool' which
//	is gathering data, based on mouse movements and other things. If
//	these fail, we also add in the user-supplied key. The strategy being
//	that even if it is not random, it *is* secret from the attacker point
//	of view, by definition. The problem which may be hard to predict the
//	effect of is of course some kind of inter-dependency between key
//	encrypting keys and data encrypting keys.
//	Just for forms sake, we also here (but not to the entropy pool)
//	add in some time, which is the usual, not-so-good-idea. Better ideas
//	are appreciated as comments to me!
