//
//	Initializes a property sheet extension, context menu extension, or drag-and-drop handler.
//
//	Returns NOERROR if successful, or an OLE-defined error value otherwise.
//	pidlFolder
//		Address of an ITEMIDLIST structure that uniquely identifies a folder.
//		For property sheet extensions, this parameter is NULL. For context menu extensions,
//		it is the item identifier list for the folder that contains the item whose context
//		menu is being displayed. For nondefault drag-and-drop menu extensions,
//		this parameter specifies the target folder. (This seems to be untrue - I get
//      no pidl to folder for my context menu extension... :-( /SS).
//	lpdobj
//		Address of anIDataObject interface object that can be used to retrieve
//		the objects being acted upon.
//	hkeyProgID
//		Registry key for the file object or folder type.
