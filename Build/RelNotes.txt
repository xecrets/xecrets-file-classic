Added Czech translation - thank you Miroslav Geisselreiter!

1.7.2931 Release 2012-07-20
Minor refactorizations and feature enhancement, including OpenCandy
dependency update.

1.7.2867 Release 2011-12-04
This is a major refactorisation of the build and the dependency handling.
We now fully support building AxCrypt with 100% free tools such as
Visual C++ Express 2010, MSBuild and WiX. There is also support for
a single installer for 32-bit and 64-bit both. Installation recommendations
by OpenCandy are supported by the installer which are fully optional.
Minor bugfixes. Dependency updates (Crypto++, ZLib, WTL, ATL, SDK, Tools)
to the very latest.

1.7.2687.0 Release 2011-09-23
This release supersedes version 1.7.2126 and incorporates all changes
documented in the change log from then. This release is a major rebuild
with no new functionality. It updates libraries to current versions and
the build environment to the current version. There is also a change to
make it work better in some terminal server environments.

1.7.2614 Release 2011-08-06
This release supersedes version 1.7.2126 and incorporates all changes
documented in the change log from then. This release is a minor change
which only fixes an issue with the right-click menu.

1.7.2610 Release 2011-08-05
This release supersedes version 1.7.2126 and incorporates all changes
documented in the change log from then. The release is a minor change
which includes Russion support as an additional language, Windows
2000 being obsolete an no longer supported as well as a few bug-fixes.

supported.

1.7.2126.0 Release 2010-04-19
This release supersedes version 1.6.4.4 and incorporates all changes
documented in the change log from then. The release is a major change
with the change of installer technology to Windows Installer and the
support for 64-bit in all current versions of Windows being the most
visible changes. It also corrects a number of bugs, including some
memory leaks and crashes and is fully Unicode-aware.

1.7.2067.0 Beta 2010-03-28
Improved fault detection in the memory allocation code caught a
previously undetected double delete, causing a SecondaryExecuteRequest
[EN_GETTHREADEXIT] direct exit instead of a silent memory leak.

1.7.2029.0 Beta 2010-03-23
A number of bug fixes, some significant for specific scenarios. The
most useful is better ability to work with Office 2007 and some
anti virus software without false permissions problems. Also some
fixes for long running command line initiated tasks. See change
log for details.

1.7.1970.0 Beta 2010-02-23
Minor bug fixes. See change log for details.

1.7.1878.0 Beta 2007-12-06

Fix context menu on XP 64 bit and similar.

1.7.1836.0 Beta 2009-10-11

more problems than it solves.

1.7.1813.0 Beta 2009-09-13
Improved installer, fix a memory leak causing crashes in large
jobs.

1.7.1796.0 Beta 2009-08-29
First Beta of 64-bit version with MSI-based installer. It is now
released as two packages, a 32-bit and a 64-bit installer and software.

1.6.4.4 2008-05-13
Release of 1.6b4.3.

1.6b4.3 2008-04-27
Bug fixes, see change notes.

1.6b4.2 2008-04-10
Windows Vista has introduced a brilliant new feature in the name of
security (sic!) which causes the address space of processes to be
randomly assigned. This caused a latent bug to surface, causing
random crashes and taskbar freezes. Another latent bug caused Vista
to silently kill the process instead of showing it's exception
dialog. In the end a rather major edit with lots of cleanup as a
result.

1.6.4.1 2008-03-17
Fixed a major issue with not using provided passphrase when encrypting
in batch files via the command line.

1.6.4 2008-03-07
Final release of the changes in 1.6b3.1 through 1.6b.3.3 plus a few
minor changes.

1.6b3.3 2008-02-07
Include AxCrypt2Go beta in the distribution. Enable use of Unicode
filenames (legacy versions will use translated name).

1.6b3.2 2008-01-29
Further changes to make it more Vista-aware. The largest change is
re-compilation as a full Unicode application and dropping support for
Windows 95, 98, ME and NT. We're no open for translations to more
languages, as we're not limited in the texts. Filenames are still
stored in Ansi only, will be fixed in next version.

1.6b3.1 2008-01-08
Minor bugfixes, but major upgrade of library code and development-
environment to Visual Studio 2005. Vista support in installer and code.
Fix of problem with networked folders in Windows XP after Microsoft
security update.

1.6.3 2006-06-16
The major changes include a rewrite of the basic mechanism for reading
and writing data, shifting away from memory mapped file I/O to regular
I/O as there are indications that some networks and VPN software are
not fully compatible with memory mapped I/O, at the worst causing data
loss. Robustness before peformance, so... Also, Danish is now supported.
Finally some minor changes and bugs are fixed of course.

1.6.2.3 2006-02-26
A maintenance release, fixes a bug in AxDecrypt causing it not to run
on Windows 98, now with Dutch language support!

1.6.2 2006-01-01
Various minor bugs fixed. Incidentally, most of the time spent since
the previous release has been for the the next version of AxCrypt which
is the reason for the lack of major new functionality. This also explains
for those of you downloading the source, why you'll get a message stating
that the "AxCrypt2Go" project could not be found when you start Visual
Studio. Just click ok, the source for that is just not included currently.

1.6.1 2005-03-16
Several annoyances removed, basically a bug-fix release. A potentially
major bug in the uninstaller was fixed, under very unusual circumstances
the uninstaller could remove more files than intended. This only applies
if non-standard install locations were choosen during install, if so
you should upgrade to this version before attempting uninstall.

1.6 2004-11-27
A major update, although few changes are visible to users.
AxCrypt now supports trial use and strong digitally signed product
activation codes. Irrelevant for the GPL version which remains free.
A number of more or less minor bugs fixed, the most serious causing
upgrade installations to fail. Nothing with security impact.
Hungarian language is now supported!

1.5.4.2 2004-09-11
A very minor release. Fix a bug when upgrading previous versions
in the installer.

1.5.4 2004-08-28
A maintenance release fixing various minor bugs and annoyances, the
most serious causing failed upgrades. Self-decrypting archives now
start with a simplified dialog.

1.5.3.1 2004-06-29
A patch for an re-/uninstall problem when using a custom Start Menu
location, other Start Menu folders may get unintentionally deleted.

1.5.3 2004-06-28
A maintenance release with various bug-fixes and minor new
features. Some prettier dialogs, true upgrade instead of uninstall
followed by re-install, a bug reporting option on the context
menu etc. The most critical bug-fix is broken NT4 compatibility.
Minor documentation updates.

1.5.2 2004-05-05
Completed the Spanish translation. Kudos to Jacobo Fortuny Ayuso!
A bug-fix, fixing loss of edited changes on network disconnect
or forced removal of device. New feature to allow encrypt-to-copy
from Windows Explorer. Migrated to more recent compiler and
compression library. New documentation content and web site design.

1.5.1 2004-03-21
Many bug-fixes and minor improvements. None with security
impact. Major new functionality in support of self-decrypting
files, stand-alone install-free decrypt-only program.
Generation and usage of key-files. Dynamic determination
of key wrap iteration count depending on computer speed.

1.4.3 2003-08-11
Bug-fixes and improvements. 1.4.2 introduced a few problems
in the application launch-logic, that's now further improved
and fixed. A memory leak and a handle leak was fixed.
Wild cards should work now.

1.4.2 2003-07-04
Mostly a bug-fix release. Many changes and additions too.
One major annoyance, causing it to be unable to
run as a non-Administrator on NT/2K/XP fixed. A serious
problem (but affects very few) with file corruption in
unusual network situations fixed. Due to that also made it
possible to decrypt a file even if the HMAC is broken,
but it requires enabling in the registry. Improved
handling of read only files and removable media. Most
wanted feature wild-cards on the command line is now
implemented.

1.4.1 2003-01-06
Some minor annoyances with operations on the Desktop and
Network Neighborhood on Win9x fixed. No longer reports
file in use sometimes when attempting to open on XP/2K.
Huge files could cause excessive disk space usage during
operations. Fixed a situation where a previously used
decryption key would become the default encryption key.

1.4 2002-11-27
Major fixes includes handling of .zip files in Windows XP,
and a file wiping bug, causing data to be left unwiped in
certain cases, depending on timing and os version. Also,
Italian language texts are now included. Several minor
changes, additions and bug-fixes. Recommend upgrade from
previous version.

1.3.0.2 2002-08-28
Three minor bugs, one which was a memory leak, causing it
to spontaneously combust (i.e. crash with Access Violation)
after some time on a system with heavy usage.

1.3 2002-08-25
More command-line options to test for key in cache, anonymous
rename from shell extension and command line, flag to ignore
already encrypted from command-line. Most of all, only compress
on need. Incompatible file-format change unfortunately,i.e.
older versions can't read files produced by 1.3. Hopefully
this is the last such change in a while.

1.2.1 2002-08-20
Fixes, changes and additions to improve command-line and
non-interactive usage, server mode. Code clean-up and
some minor bug-fixes. Not released to the web.

1.2 2002-08-14
One major bugfix affecting security, will read older files
but previous releases will not read the new files.

Major reworking of the user interface allowing multi file
and folder selection, as well as displaying progress bar
visual feedback on longer operations.

Caching can be turned on or off optionally for both
encryption default key and decryption keys.

A complete and documented command-line interface is now
available for programmatic access to the functionality.

Spanish language texts added.

Internally some rewriting of the resident server code.
Lots of minor bugfixes.

1.1 2002-04-26
Release 1.1. Minor bugfixes. German and French language texts.
The source package now includes project and workspace files
for direct re-build using VC++.

1.0c1.1 2002-03-23
Upgraded to Zlib 1.1.4 after CERT advisory. No other changes.

1.0c1 2002-03-06
Release Candidate 1. Only minor bug-fixes, changes and additions from Beta 6.

0.0b6 2002-01-27
This is the final Beta Release before release candidate 1.
Improvements in key wrapping, entropy gathering and pseudo
random number generation. Full support for 64-bit file-sizes.
Final file format changes done as previously planned. No
further changes planned for version 1, and if any are found
absolutely necessary, backward compatibility will apply.
Code structure and robustness further increased.
Many bug-fixes.

0.0b5 2002-01-02
This beta includes now works on XP as well, which beta 4 did not.
It is known to work on 98/2K/XP.
Acknowledgements of successful testing on 95/NT/ME appreciated.
The major visible change is that the context menu now uses the program name
as a starting point for a sub-menu that may include several
possible options. New is 'Wipe and Delete' functionality. Internally
there are some bug-fixes and preparations for full 64-bit file size
support. Improved temp-file location and allocation. Improved handling of
system shutdown and logoff.
THE NEXT BETA WILL BE FINAL AND WILL INCLUDE INCOMPATIBLE FILE FORMAT CHANGES!
