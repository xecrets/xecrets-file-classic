- Added use of Pentium cycle counter as entropy source.
- Increased default KeyWrapIterations to 10000, instead of 6.

- Move secured heap into Temp-directory toplevel subdirectory.
- Fix: Do not SaveEntropy() when exiting after maintenance-only actions such as UnInstall.
- Ensure use of (limited and defined) Ansi charset on passphrase reading.
