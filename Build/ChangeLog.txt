- New: Now handles multiple file selections and folders.
- New: Caches default encryption key too.
- New: Registry sticky choice of caching keys or not.
- New: Warns about file system encrypted or compressed files when wiping.
- New: Ensures that the program temp directory is not compressed.
- New: Full-featured command-line interface.
- Fix: Clean-up of main code.
- Fix: Changed strategy for starting main process thread, now always orthogonal.
- Fix: Some minor corrections and changes to texts.

1.1 2002-04-26
- Bug: Sometimes failed with message about CEntropy::Invalid Handle when cleaning up old temp data.
- Bug: Would not pick correct forced language first time in a dialogue.
- Bug: May not pick correct key wrap iteration count from registry.
- Bug: May skip first file deleting tmp-dir. Changed while() {} to do {} while()
- Add: German translation by Juergen Nieveler - Thank You!
- Add: French translation by Carl Seleborg - Thank You!

1.0c1.1 2002-03-23
- Security fix: Zlib upgrade to  1.1.4 after CERT advisory

1.0c1 2002-03-06
- Bug: Editing Excel document in already opened Excel failed at close after saved changes.
- Bug: Accumulating timer interrupts during suspend causing long resume time in portables.
- Bug: Logging off sometimes caused entropy timer problem. Cleanup to not use WM_TIMER, only threads.
- Bug: Handle leak in LogEvent() caused exception "Reading Event Log Level", insufficient resources.
- Chg: Use parity bit of low 32 bits from RDTSC instead of bit 0 in CEntropy::GatherThread()
- Fix: sha1 code is now reentrant, i.e. thread-safe.
- Add: DefaultLanguageId in registry to force language selection

0.0b6 2002-01-27
- Apartment threading compatibility for ShellExt as InprocServer32.
- Proper class implementation of entropy pool.
- Added a software bit oscillator-based entropy source.
- Added use of Pentium cycle counter as entropy source.
- Increased default KeyWrapIterations to 10000, instead of 6.
- Read KeyWrapIterations from registry, to prepare for user-settable option.
- Salt the input to the Key Wrap Algorithm with 16-bytes of PRNG'd salt.
- Make a doc-folder and a separate package for that.
- Selfdestructing class template for handles to ensure handle closure.
- Selfdestructing class template for pointers to ensure pointer deletion.
- Auto wipe of left-over files in 'Program' temp directory structure.
- Cleanup: Create a Utility module for misc utility functions.
- Proper Key Wrapping using AES Key Wrapping Specification
- Move secured heap into Temp-directory toplevel subdirectory.
- Fix: Do not SaveEntropy() when exiting after maintenance-only actions such as UnInstall.
- Ensure use of (limited and defined) Ansi charset on passphrase reading.
- 64-bit file lengths in appropriate headers. Header lengths will remain 32 bit.
- Implicit info about encryption alg, key len etc in the file format.
- Support for optional encryption in the file format.
- Support for optional compression in the file format.
- GUID first, not in a header.

0.0b5 2002-01-02
- Bug fix: The Context Menu now works on XP as well.
- Bug fix: the secured heap was not always delete'd properly, is now.
- Improved temp files and directory handling. Now all under ...\Program except for secured heap
- Code now supports 64-bit file lengths. Will implement in file format together with other changes.
- Version numbers are fetched from version resource, not constants and strings in the code.
- Sub-context-menu to allow multiple operations.
- New 'Wipe' command implemented.
- Improved handling of system shutdown, logoff and forced exit.
- Event logging to text file Program.log in windows directory (if enabled in registry).
- New logic for keeping track of active threads.
- NEXT BETA WILL BE FINAL AND WILL INCLUDE INCOMPATIBLE FILE FORMAT CHANGES!

0.0b4 2001-12-02
- Fixed loop with 'Decrypt and Unwrap' of files longer than 1024 bytes.
- Move plain text-files under editing into unique directories under temp dir.
- Pre-scan headers, avoid 'memory alloc' errors and give clearer reports on invalid files.
- Completely new logic for how to detect when document editing is done.
- Wait for application exit on system shutdown or logoff
- Improved PRNG with entropy pool, both persistent in registry and volatile in memory.
- Verify encryption padding to increase robustness.
- Handle system shutdown and logoff gracefully (can still be improved...)
- Only use secured heap in primary instance
- Plugged some memory leaks and implemented heap checkpointing
- Further improvements to decrypt-and-launch logic

0.0b3
- Fixed crash with "Error in system call CloseHandle()" on second start of the Program.

0.0b2 2001-11-19
- Allocate 10 proc id's at a time in CChildProc, debug value was 1.
- Moved CloseHandle of worker threads to CActiveThreads, and asserted.
