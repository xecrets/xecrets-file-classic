	@(#) $Id$

	Define some parameter values for BaseM encoding/decoding.

	AnyBase is the base of the representation
	BitPrecision is the total number of bits that the final representation is to have
		This is necessary to reserve the appropriate space etc. As a BaseM representation may
		not divide conveniently into a few bytes this gets a bit more complicated than for
		example base 8, base 16 or for that matter base 64.
