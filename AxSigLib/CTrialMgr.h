/// A handler of small counts in a somewhat obscure manner. The idea is that for trial software
/// you need to keep track of a few counters, with small values - typically the number of uses
/// or the number of days since installation, or the number of days used etc. This class implements
/// this in a way that should work even when there is no user profile, such as when running as a
/// service or in a terminal server environment with mandatory profiles. This puts severe restrictions
/// on what we can do. At this time, we try to create and write a hidden file with a non-obvious name
/// in the %TEMP% or %TMP% directory. If that fails, we silently do nothing. If someone deletes the
/// file, what happens is we revert to the start of the trial period. The actual counter is encoded as
/// increments in the 'modify' time of the file, relative the 'create' time.
