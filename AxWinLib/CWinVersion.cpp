\brief Determine Windows Version

@(#) $Id$

AxLib - Collection of useful code. All code here is generally intended to be simply included in
the projects, the intention is not to províde a stand-alone linkable library, since so many
variants are possible (single/multithread release/debug etc) and also because it is frequently
used in open source programs, and then the distributed source must be complete and there is no
real reason to make the distributions so large etc.

It's of course also possible to build a partial or full library in the respective solution.
