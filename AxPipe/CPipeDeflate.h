		///
		/// Ensure that this file has an extra include directory so zlib.h is found.
		/// Also, either include the zlib project as a static or dynamic library, or
		/// manually include the following files for compilation with zlib 1.2.1:
		///     deflate.c, adler32.c, crc32.c, inffast.c, inftrees.c, zutil.c
		///
		/// If you define NO_GZIP, the executable shrinks and you don't need crc32.c,
		/// but you won't be able to default that format.
		///
		/// The compression strategy used here is to allocate a memory buffer
		/// m_cbChunkSize in size. This is always filled before output to the next
		/// stage. For each segment that is sent to us, we always consume it fully.
		/// If m_cbFlushInterval is non-zero, we output a full zlib Z_FULL_FLUSH
		/// with every time we have consumed that many bytes from the input. This allows
		/// decompression to recover, and a single error in the stream will at most
		/// result in that many lost bytes of source.
		/// There is always a one-to-one relation betweem m_pOutSeg's buffer and the
		/// buffer referred to by m_Zstream.
		/// We also provide zlib memory allocation stubs that use C++ 'new' and 'delete'
		/// to ensure that overrides of these are used for zlib too.
