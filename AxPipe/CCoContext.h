	/// \brief Encapsulate a co-routine context.
	///
	/// A co-routine is a context that executes along with other co-routines
	/// in the same process and thread, but with it's own stack, registers and
	/// program counter - sort of a very light weight thread, but with no
	/// independent scheduling, and by definition no concurrent or parallell
	/// execution.
	///
	/// In Windows Win32, this concept is called a 'fiber'.
	/// A CCoContext can be initalized to represent the already executing current
	/// context, or to create a new execution context. In most cases you first
	/// want to make a context represent the current context, then create a new
	/// context, that can then switch back to the original and then back again as
	/// needed.
	///
	/// The constructors may be called in any context. No creation or switching
	/// of contexts are done there.
	///
	/// Each CCoContext object thus represents one co-routine context in a thread.
	class CCoContext {
		DWORD m_dwThreadId;                     ///< The thread we started the fiber in.
		LPVOID m_pFiber;                        ///< This objects co-routine state
