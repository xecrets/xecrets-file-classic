	/// \brief A small collection of objects and methods for thread sync
	///
	/// Threads often need synchronized access to shared data, and control
	/// the the passing of the data. This class implements methods for this
	/// under a 'work' paradigm. Thread A wants to pass off a piece of work
	/// in some form of shared medium, i.e. shared memory for example, to
	/// thread B. The sequence is then:
	///     A                                   B
	///                                         ...
	///                                         WorkWait()
	///     ...
	///     WorkStart()
	///     WorkSignal()
	///                                         ...
	///                                         WorkEnd()
	///
	/// The methods ensure that when WorkStart() returns, no other thread is between
	/// WorkStart() and WorkEnd(). It's also guaranteed that when WorkSignal()
	/// returns, thread B has received the signal via WorkWait(). Owneship of the
	/// shared resource passes from A to B upon return from WorkSignal() and WorkWait()
	/// respectively. Thread B relinquishes it's hold, upon call to WorkEnd(), and as
	/// previously noted Thread A get's ownership upon return of WorkStart().
