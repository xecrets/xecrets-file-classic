	///
	/// CSegMap is able to release a view instead of delete'ing upon destruction.
	/// It also implements run time typing to distinguish it, as well as an owner
	/// mechanism whereby a class can tag and subsequently recognize a segment as
	/// on that it 'owns' and thus handles.
	///
	/// The actual mapping of the file is handled outside of this class, but it can,
	/// and will, unmap the view.
	/// \todo Bring together the MapUserView() functionality into the constructor here,
	/// it really makes no sense to have it done outside. It just happended that way
	/// due to historic reasons.
