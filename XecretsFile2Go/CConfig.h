	\brief CConfig.h - Configuration information for XecretsFile2Go

	@(#) $Id$

	XecretsFile2Go - Stand-Alone Install-free Xecrets File Classic for the road.

	This file defines configuration data that might differ for different builds, and provides an
	interface for the rest of the code to fetch strings and other values that might differ between
	configurations. One specific use is to differentiate OEM versions, the GPL version (user built) and the
	official free version.

	The requirement is to have as little as possible, preferrably nothing, to be compile-time dependent. The
	only things that should be compile time dependent are those that by definition has to do with compilation,
	specifically various debug versions.

	The goal is to have one compile for all versions, and version specific strings and information to be
	either patched after the build into the executable, or have them contained in an external configuration
	file, typically a signed XML-file. The actual strategy may vary depending on the target platform.
