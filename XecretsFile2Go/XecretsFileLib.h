	\brief XecretsFileLib.h - An Xecrets File Classic support library

	@(#) $Id$

	XecretsFileLib - An Xecrets File Classic support library

	This interface may be used directly by code implementing Xecrets File Classic-functions.

	The library is built around a single parameter buffer, which is a struct AXCL_PARAM
	and various function calls, passing this parameter buffer and other things as parameters.

	There are operations to encrypt, decrypt, reencrypt and get encrypted meta data.
	There is also an independent set of operations to manage a cache of keys.

	The operations and their parameters are defined as C-style functions, structures, pre-processor defines
	and enums to make the library maximally useful by callers. Internally it's still C++.
	The operations are defined as separate functions to enable minimal builds by excluding unused code in
	the linker.

	The library is OS and environment independent, and uses callbacks as it's mechanism to implement
	specifics and dependencies of such nature. The user of the library must specify the address of
	a callback function, with the signature typedef void *XecretsFileLibCallbackT(AXCL_PARAM *, int iCallbackAction) .

	Typical actions are AXCL_A_PROGRESS to report progress and check for cancel, AXCL_A_GET_CIPHER_PATH to get
	the full path to encipher to, possibly via a user dialog, AXCL_A_GET_PLAIN_PATH to get the full path
	to decrypto to, possilby via a user dialog and AXCL_A_TCHAR2ANSI and AXCL_A_ANSI2TCHAR to convert to and
	from Ansi respectively.

	The library uses it's own pretty-much-compatible version of the Windows API concept of a _TCHAR for
	a mutable character type that may be wide or not depending on compilation options, and it defines
	the necessary types and macros for this. Windows programmers should be aware that _TT is used instead
	of _T to avoid collissions with the Windows definition. You control if _TCHAR is wide by defining the
	preprocessor constant _UNICODE. If _TCHAR is not wide, i.e. _UNICODE is not defined, conversion to and
	from Ansi is a null operation. There is no support for UTF-8 encoding of Unicode in a 'char'.

	All memory allocation/deallocation is handled internally by the library by new/delete. Do not copy pointers, only
	data from the library, do not attempt to free/delete any data from the library. If the application
	requires secure memory handling, this must be achieved by overriding the global new and delete operators. The library
	does not use malloc/free explicitly.

	All paths and strings are communicated as TCHAR's, i.e. potentially Unicode, but not necessarily.

	The following basic operations are supported by the library:

	- Encrypt a file
	- Decrypt a file
	- Re-encrypt a file under a different passphrase - this does not actually change the master-key, only the key-encrypting-key
	- Determine meta information from the headers, such as file-times, and plain-file name. Possibly size etc too.

	The typical encryption process is:

		- The caller determines the full path of the plain-text input
		- The caller determines the file name of the plain-text to store in the encrypted result
		- The caller determines the file times of the input file
		- The caller gets a parameter structure, providing it's own context info etc.
		- The caller optionally determines the passphrase and key-file, and calls the library to hash this to a key encrypting key OR ...
		- ... determines the key encrypting key by some other means, such as retrieving it from a store or cache using a fingerprint
		- The caller requests encryption with the parameters (parameter structure (with kek and file times), full path, plain file name)
		- The library opens the plain-text, starts the encryption process AND ...
		- ... calls back to convert the plain-text file name to Ansi AND ...
		- ... calls back to determine the output path, providing the parameter block as a help. The result is a full path to the output, which is copied.
		- The library then creates the output file, starts the encryption AND ...
		- ... periodically calls back to report progress and check for cancellation in the same call.
		- When the encryption is finished, or cancel is requested, all resources are freed and the original call to Encrypt returns with appropriate status
		- The caller does any further processing of file attributes such as file times, read-only etc etc

	For encryption we need:

		- A callback to get a full encryption result path AXCL_PATHOUT, given a default result path AXCL_PATHOUT
		- A callback to explicitly (possibly null) convert from TCHAR's iBuf to char's 'charString', with the option to ask for buffer size

	The decryption process is:

		- The caller determines the full path of the cipher-text input file
		- The caller optionally determines the passphrase and key-file, and calls the library to hash this to a key encrypting key OR ...
		- ... determines the key encrypting key by some other means, such as retrieving it from a store or cache
		- The caller requests decryption with the pair (full path, key encrypting key) plus suggested output path
		- The library opens the cipher-text, and attempts to decrypt the headers with the provided key encrypting key and EITHER ...
		- ... returns with an error code stating that the provided key was wrong OR ...
		- ... starts the decryption process, AND ...
		- ... calls back to convert the file name from the headers to TCHAR AND...
		- ... calls back to determine the output path, providing the suggested output path plus the file name found in the headers. The callback MAY ...
		- ... call the library to reallocate the output path buffer, and update it. The result is a full path to the output.
		- The library then creates the output file, continues the decryption, stores the original file times from the headers AND ...
		- ... periodically calls back to report progress and check for cancellation in the same call.
		- When the decryption is finished, or cancel is requested, all resources are freed and the original call to Decrypt returns with appropriate status
		- The caller does any further processing of file attributes such as file times, read-only etc
		- The caller provides logic for launching if required

	For decryption we need:
		- A callback to get a full decryption result path AXCL_PATHOUT, given a default result path AXCL_PATHOUT
		- A callback to explicitly (possilby null) convert from char's 'charString' to TCHAR's iBuf, with the option to ask for buffer size

	Re-encrypt process is:

		- The caller determins the full path of the cipher-text input file
		- The caller optionally determines the old passphrase and key-file, and calls the library to hash this to a key encrypting key OR ...
		- ... determines the key encrypting key by some other means, such as retrieving it from a store or cache
		- The caller optionally determines the new passphrase and key-file, and calls the library to hash this to a key encrypting key OR ...
		- ... determines the key encrypting key by some other means, such as retrieving it from a store or cache
		- The caller requests re-encryption with the parameters (full input path, old key-enc-key, new key-enc-key)
		- The caller opens the input file, verifies and recalculates the HMAC at the same time AND ...
		- ... periodically calls back to report progress and check for cancellation in the same call.
		- When the operation is finished, or cancel is requested, all resources are freed and the original library call returns with appropriate status
		- The caller does any further processing of file attributes such as file times, read-only etc

	Get meta info process is:
		- The caller determins the full path of the cipher-text input file
		- The caller optionally determines the decryption passphrase and key-file, and calls the library to hash this to a key encrypting key OR ...
		- ... determines the key encrypting key by some other means, such as retrieving it from a store or cache
		- The caller requetss meta data with the parameters (full input path, dec key-enc-key)
		- The caller opens the input file, decrypts the headers and optionally verifies the HMAC AND ...
		- ... periodically calls back to report progress and check for cancellation in the same call.
		- When the operation is finished, or cancel is requested, all resources are freed and the original library call returns with appropriate status

	Common stuff:
		- AXCL_PATHIN The full path name used to open the input file. We assume that AxPipe is capable of portably opening it.
		- A callable function to (re-)allocate memory for AXCL_PATHOUT, AXCL_PATHIN, AXCL_PATHKEY, AXCL_FILENAME
		- A callable function to hash a passphrase 'pPassphrase/cbPassphrase' and possibly a key-file AXCL_PATHKEY to a key encrypting key pKEK/cbKEK.
		- A callback to report progress in the scale of 0-10000, and check for cancellation
