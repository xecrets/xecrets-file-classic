//
//	Generate subkeys for various uses. This class has two main purposes:
//
//	1 - to avoid conflicts caused by using the same subkey in different contexts.
//	2 - to isolate knowledge of relationship between key-size and block-size.
//
//	Exposing one or more subkeys must not endanger either the other subkeys, or the
//	master key. In fact, the eValidator key is exposed in the file, and never used
//	for actual encryption.
//
//	We actually do is to encrypt constants using the master key, until we get enough
//	bits for a key.
