How to build AxCrypt

Introduction
============

AxCrypt is distributed as an open source software under a GPL license. This is presumably how you came into posession of this file
and all the rest.

There are some things to know about building AxCrypt. While I cannot give support for GPL builds, I still want to give some pointers on the
requirements. This list may be incomplete, please let me know if this is the case, contact me at software@axantum.com .

- When you first load the solution, you may get a "Security Warning for Setup". Please select "Load project normally". This is by design.

- Because of inconsistencies in various packages included in AxCrypt, there are three platforms actually defined, and Visual Studio may
  start off with a default of 'Mixed Platforms'. Change this immediately, and only build for 'Win32' and 'x64'. (Not x86 - that's for
  the Setup project).
  
- Build the Win32 configuration first, since the x64 configuration depends on it.
  
- AxCrypt is developed with Visual Studio 2015 Professional. It is possible to build AxCrypt entirely
  with free tools (Visual Studio 2015 Community and/or MSBuild).

- There are some special tweaks to handle the different build environments for AxCrypt, such as GPL Builds, Axantum developer builds and
  Axantum build server builds. This is why you'll find some conditional code in various MSBuild project files.
  
- The end-result is not 100% binary identical to the released binaries, since they are timestamped and digitally signed, as well as
  versioned in the continuous integration build server setup by Axantum Software AB.

Tools and Dependencies Installation
===================================

Executive summary (details in respective section below):

- Install, set AX_CRYPTOPP=install-path and build Crypto++ 5.6.5 (or later at your own risk)
- Install, set AX_ZLIB=install-path and build zlib 1.2.11 (or later at your own risk)
- Install WTL 9.1.5321 and set AX_WTL=Install-path (or later at your own risk)
- Install Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition or Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 Professional Edition or better.
- Install Windows Installer XML (WiX) toolset v3.10.3 (or later at your own risk)
- Start Visual Studio 2015, open the AxCrypt solution, and build.

AX_XXX refers to environment variables, used to refer to external dependency disk locations.

If you already have some components installed, just follow the list in the above order and skip the ones you already have.

It takes about 2 hours to set the whole thing up from scratch. These procedures have been tested on 64-bit Windows 10 Professional,
and 64-bit Windows Server 2012 Standard. It should work equally well on all current Windows editions, but it has not been tested.

Details follows.

DEVELOPER PC VS BUILD SERVER
============================

We typically place contributed dependencies in (except when there is a default installlocation):

Developer PC: "C:\Users\[UserName]\Documents\Contrib\[CONTRIBUTION]"
Build Server: "C:\Lib\[CONTRIBUTION]"
        
Crypto++
========

Download Crypto++ Library 5.6.5 (or possibly later at your own risk) from http://www.cryptopp.com, unpack the zip-file.

Set the environment variable AX_CRYPTOPP to point to the installation directory, perhaps "C:\Users\[UserName]\Documents\Contrib\cryptopp565" .

Open %AX_CRYPTOPP%\cryptlib.vcxproj in Visual Studio, say yes to upgrade ignore the warnings.

Change 'cryptlib'
(for all Configurations and all Platforms)

Properties | General | Platform Toolset to:
"Visual Studio 2015 - Windows XP (v140_xp)"

Save the project and solution.

Open VS2015 x86 Native Tools Command Prompt

cd  %AX_CRYPTOPP%
msbuild cryptlib.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Debug;Platform=Win32
msbuild cryptlib.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Release;Platform=Win32

Open VS2015 x64 Native/Cross Tools Command Prompt

cd  %AX_CRYPTOPP%
msbuild cryptlib.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Debug;Platform=x64
msbuild cryptlib.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Release;Platform=x64

zlib
====

Download zlib 1.2.11 (or possibly later at your own risk) from http://www.zlib.net in zipfile format and unpack the zip-file.

Set the environment variable AX_ZLIB to point to the installation directory, perhaps "C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\Contrib\zlib-1.2.11" .

Due to a bug in zlibstat.vcxproj:

Open %AX_ZLIB%\contrib\vstudio\vc14\zlibvc.sln in Visual Studio, say yes to upgrade ignore the warnings.

Change 'zlibstat'
(for all Configurations and Win32|x64)

Properties | General | Platform Toolset to:
"Visual Studio 2015 - Windows XP (v140_xp)"

Change Properties | Configuration Properties | C/C++ | Code Generation | Runtime Library

Debug and All Platforms to:
"Multi-threaded Debug (/MTd)"

Release and x64 (and Win32 - but it's ok in 1.2.11) to:
"Multi-threaded (/MT)"

Also change (for all Configurations and Win32 & x64)

Properties | Configuration Properties | General | Platform Toolset to:
"Visual Studio 2015 - Windows XP (v140_xp)"

Save the solution and project!

Open VS2015 x86 Native Tools Command Prompt

cd %AX_ZLIB%\contrib\masmx86
bld_ml32.bat

cd %AX_ZLIB%\contrib\vstudio\vc14
msbuild zlibstat.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Debug;Platform=Win32
msbuild zlibstat.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Release;Platform=Win32

Open VS2015 x64 Native Tools Command Prompt

cd %AX_ZLIB%\contrib\masmx64
bld_ml64.bat

cd %AX_ZLIB%\contrib\vstudio\vc14
msbuild zlibstat.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Debug;Platform=x64
msbuild zlibstat.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Release;Platform=x64

WTL
===

Download WTL 9.1 (or possibly later at your own risk) from http://sourceforge.net/projects/wtl/files/ .

Set the environment variable AX_WTL to point to the installation directory, perhaps "C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\Contrib\WTL91_5321_Final" .

WTL needs no building, it's just a set of header files. But it does depend on ATL, Active Template Library, which is *not* included
in the SDK or express edition of Visual Studio, but you can get it via the Windows Driver Kit. See more below.

ATL
===

ATL is part of Visual Studio 2015 Professional and Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition. No further action is needed.

Otherwise...

ATL needs no building, it's a set of header files and the libraries are pre-built.

MSBuild.Community.Tasks
=======================

The build process is dependent on a few extensions to MSBuild. It is included via a nuget package.

Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows
======================================

It was possible to build AxCrypt with Visual Studio Express 2013 Express for Windows (the free version), although the .MSI installers must
be built from the command line in this case. It has not been tested with Visual Studio 2013 Express or the current code base.

Download Windows Driver Kit 7.1 (no later, ATL is removed) from http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=11800 .
Mount the ISO and install the 'Full Development Environment | Build Environments', typically to the standard location C:\WinDDK\7600.16385.1\ .
If you need software in order to mount the ISO as a DVD, try SlySoft Virtual CloneDrive at http://www.slysoft.com/en/virtual-clonedrive.html .
If you have disabled Autoplay, it's the 'KitSetup.exe' that you should run.

You'll also have to add the libraries to AxCrypt2Go linker properties, and then include directory to the properties so it can build.

If you have Visual Studio 2015 Professional or better, you can build it all from inside Visual Studio.

Check for updates at Microsoft with Windows Update, and be sure to explicitly search for updates. Install all important updates.

Visual Studio 2012 Update 2
===========================

It was possible to build AxCrypt with Visual Studio 2012 Update 2, but this has not been regression-tested with the current code base.

It's essential to upgrade Visual Studio to the latest update, because AxCrypt uses features that are not available otherwise, such as
targeting Windows XP. You'll find this in the Visual Studio 2012 Tools | Extensions and Updates | Updates menu dialog. This is not
required for Visual Studio 2013, which includes the XP headers from start.

Windows Installer XML (WiX) toolset
===================================

WiX is required to build the MSI setup. There is support for building from Visual Studio 2015 Community or better. You still need to install WiX.

Get Windows Installer XML (WiX) toolset v3.10.2.2516 (or later at your own risk) from http://wix.codeplex.com/ . Double-click to install after download and follow
the instructions.

Build the Solution
==================

Start Visual Studio and open AxCrypt.sln. 

- You may get a warning about only opening projects from a trustworthy source. If you trust your source
  of AxCrypt, click OK and continue.

For Express:

- You'll get a warning about Setup.wixproj not being supported. Click OK and ignore...
- ...and as a result a warning about not all projects being loaded correctly. Click OK and ignore.

Now you can build the solution (except the installer when using Visual Studio Express).

Building from the command line
==============================

All is built using MSBuild. Please see Microsoft documentation for details. Briefly:

- Open a Developer Command Prompt for VS2015
- Change current directory to the location of the source code.
- Use the following to build for various configurations and platforms:

    "%VSINSTALLDIR%vc\vcvarsall" x86
    MSBuild AxCrypt.sln /p:Configuration=Debug;Platform=Win32
    MSBuild AxCrypt.sln /p:Configuration=Release;Platform=Win32
    "%VSINSTALLDIR%vc\vcvarsall" amd64
    MSBuild AxCrypt.sln /p:Configuration=Debug;Platform=x64
    MSBuild AxCrypt.sln /p:Configuration=Release;Platform=x64

- There is a command file 'Build.cmd' in the AxCrypt solution folder that does this.

You need to build the Win32 Platform in order to build x64, since the installer contains references to executables that are only built
in for Win32 (i.e. x86 - Microsoft can't decide what name to use...).
